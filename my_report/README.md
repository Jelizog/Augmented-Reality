# Introduction
World out there, Welcome.
I'm about to show you the greatest augmented reality you always wanted. 

# Summary


# 1st Deliverable

Step-by-Step Process:

1. Just started with trials and errors about the localhost to find the python server.
2. Added the code for the camera to recognise the box
3. Inserted the sphere and the cylinder but didnt work
4. After tested out I managed to insert them
5. Then I've done research to insert the snow into the enviroment, It worked
6. I insert the speech commands and then connect them with the snow
7. I change everything inside the commands, for example the "Show menu" and the "Hide Menu"
8. Saw in the sources [link](https://lmalave.github.io/aframe-speech-command-component/examples/image-gallery.html) the code and base on that I corrected mine
9. Then just trial and error to find the sweet spot for my programm.

# 2nd Deliverable

Step-by-Step Process:

1. Started with photoshop building for the files that we ought to have ready.
2. From this [link](https://aframe.io/blog/arjs/), I made the .patt files, also helped me about the correct form of the code to inset the images.
3. I got help to make the atoms the oxygen and the hydrogen in blender.
4. I inserted them in the code (I have comments inside the code)
5. After trials and errors and small changes such as -> file names and grammar, I managed to make it happend.
