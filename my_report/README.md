# Introduction
World out there, Welcome.
I'm about to show you the greatest augmented reality you always wanted. 

# Summary


# 1st Deliverable

Step-by-Step Process:

1. Just started with trials and errors about the localhost to find the python server.
2. Added the code for the camera to recognise the box
3. Inserted the sphere and the cylinder but didnt work
4. After tested out I managed to insert them
5. Then I've done research to insert the snow into the enviroment, It worked
6. I insert the speech commands and then connect them with the snow
7. I change everything inside the commands, for example the "Show menu" and the "Hide Menu"
8. Saw in the sources [link](https://lmalave.github.io/aframe-speech-command-component/examples/image-gallery.html) the code and base on that I corrected mine
9. Then just trial and error to find the sweet spot for my programm.
